# x86-bootloader

The project is an experimental x86 [bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting) (i386) for the learning purpose. Bootloader is a piece of program that runs before the operating system when a computer is turned on. Its primary goal is to ready the system for control by the kernel. The project is emulated with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), which is a powerful machine emulator and virtualizer. 

- [x] Print a string in 16-bit real mode with BIOS interrupt call (int 0x10)
- [x] Understand the concepts of stack and function calls
- [x] Load data from disk with BIOS interrupt call (int 0x13)
- [x] Implement the global descriptor table (GDT) structure 
- [x] Switch to 32-bit protected mode: disable interrupt, load GDT, enable PE flag in CR0, flush pipeline
- [x] Print a string in 32-bit protected mode with video memory (VGA)
- [x] Load the kernel 

## Usage

Install QEMU emulator in Linux

```
$ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86
```

Hint: Press ctl+a. x to quit qemu


Install assembler
```
$ sudo apt-get install nasm
```


Run the following commands or run make command 

![](https://github.com/chuang76/x86-bootloader/blob/main/figure/demo-1.PNG?raw=true)

- Compile the assembly code into binary 
  
  ```
  $ nasm boot.asm -f bin -o boot.bin
  ```

- Compile the files about kernel and link object files into binary 
  
  ```
  $ nasm kernel_entry.asm -f elf -o kernel_entry.o
  $ gcc -m32 -fno-pie -ffreestanding -c kernel.c -o kernel.o
  $ ld -m elf_i386 -s -o kernel.bin -Ttext 0x1000 kernel_entry.o kernel.o --oformat binary 
  ```

- Concatenate two binary files into one image 
  
  ```
  $ cat boot.bin kernel.bin > bootloader
  ```

- Boot QEMU off a floppy disk
  
  ```
  $ qemu-system-i386 -fda bootloader
  ```

If you would like to debug the code, you can connect to GDB remotely with the following command:

```
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```

## Result

The program initially prints a string in 16-bit real mode using a BIOS interrupt call. Subsequently, it prepares to load the kernel from the disk and transitions to 32-bit protected mode. Finally, it successfully enters 32-bit protected mode and proceeds to load the kernel. As evident, the program executes the function within the kernel, resulting in the successful display of 'X' on the video memory.
